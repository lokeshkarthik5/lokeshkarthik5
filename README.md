## Hi there 👋 I'm Lokesh Karthik

I'm a full-stack developer, AI tinkerer, and builder of things that (hopefully) make life easier. From fast-moving SaaS platforms to smart agents that actually do stuff, I love bringing ambitious ideas to life—one commit at a time.

### 🚀 What I’m Building Right Now

- 🧠 AI-first platforms — from smart agents to TTS systems  
- ⚙️ Backend systems that are fast, scalable, and production-ready  
- 📱 React Native apps that feel smooth and natural (Shipped two)
- 🤖 Tools that blend AI with real-world utility

---

### 🌱 What I’m Exploring

- TinyML and deploying AI at the edge  
- Embedded systems + control logic  
- Multi-agent coordination using LLMs  
- Building smarter drones (software + hardware)  
- Ultra-low-latency infra for real-time applications  
- Training AI models on a budget (because GPUs aren't cheap!)

---

### 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On

- Open-source AI infra/tools  
- Dev tools or products that actually solve real pain points  
- Bootstrapped SaaS projects with clear user value  
- Anything that mixes creativity + code

---

### 💬 Things I Can Help With

- Full-stack app architecture (Next.js, Node.js, Prisma, etc.)  
- AI agent workflows and tool use (LangChain, OpenAI, vector DBs)  
- Building and shipping fast MVPs  
- Debugging why "this should work" but doesn’t 😉

### ⚡ A Few Fun Things

- I ship faster than I name projects  
- I study physics when I’m not coding  
- I’m endlessly curious—about systems, people, space, and how things work
